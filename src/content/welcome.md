ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, it's great to have you here.

We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated our new site with some initial **getting started** posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!

**A few things you should know upfront**:

1. Past8 Media is designed for ambitious, everyday folks who're interested in the financial fortune social media makes possible.
2. The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Past8 is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.
3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Past8 Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Past8 site on a desktop device.

Past8 is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Past8 Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Past8(Pro) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.

The version of Past8 you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source community.

## Next up, the editor

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: the Past8 editor. This is where the good stuff happens.

> By the way, once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Past8** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
