A lot of people have all sorts of wrong ideas about social media marketing. Some think that you only need to post "viral content" to get tons of traffic overnight.

They actually believe that if you are able to pump that much traffic to your target website, a large chunk of those people would buy whatever it is you are selling.

Maybe you're selling services, maybe you're selling an event, or maybe you are selling products from an online store, it doesn't matter. There is an assumption that social traffic, regardless of which platform it comes from and regardless of how you qualify that traffic, converts to sales readily.
