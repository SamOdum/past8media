Social media is all the rave now among companies that sell stuff, and for good reason. More and more people are getting on board social media every day. This means that the volume of people a company can jump in front of, through social media, is actively growing! And who doesn't want to partake of that goodness?

But here's the thing, most companies already have their hands full and simply can't manage a social media presence. Others simply lack the know-how necessary to use social media to their advantage. This is where you come in.

How about you devote some quality time and learn everything necessary to become a rockstar social media manager? Yes it is do-able. In short that's the reason I made this post.

I have put together a video course that will take you from **zero to hero** of social media marketing. In this course I explain,

- What a social media manager does
- The 3 things necessary to succeed in this role
- How to set your price
- How to employ and train assistants, and
- The secret software tools that automate your work

This is a premium course I could easily sell for loads of cash. But I won't. My goal is to empower you to become a **rockstar social media manager**. So, I'm going to ask you to only pay &#x20A6;4,000 to cover for some of my expenses.
